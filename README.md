Welcome to Invincal!

This calculator is able to evaluate expressions. You may also create your own constants and functions.

1.Inputting Expressions
----------------------

You may input expressions in the way you normally do in maths. Only that this calculator can only recognize the following operations:

    +     -     *     /     f(x,y,z,...)


In addition, always remember to input your expression with the right number and order of parentheses.

As a result, to get the result of 

                    9 + 3 * 0.5^(10 / 2)

please input

                    9 + 3 * pow(0.5, 10/2)
