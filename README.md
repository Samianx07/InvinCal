Welcome to Invincal!
This calculator is able to evaluate expressions. You may also create your own constants and functions.

1. Inputting Expressions
You may input expressions in the way you normally do in maths. Only that this calculator can only recognize the following operations:

	+	-	*	/	f(x,y,z,...)

In addition, always remember to input your expression with the right number and order of parentheses.
As a result, to get the result of 

			9 + 0.5^(10 / 2)
, please input 
			9 + pow(0.5, 10/2)

2. Available Built-in Functions & Constants
The following shows the available built-in functions and constants of InvinCal:
	
	Common Functions
		sqr(x)		sqrt(x)		pow(x,y)			
		log(b,x)  	log10(x)	abs(x)

	Trigonometry (inputs should be in radian form)
		sin(x)		cos(x)		tan(x)
		arcsin(x)	arccos(x)	arctan(x)
		PI (= 3.141592653589793)

	Probability
		nCr(n,r)	nPr(n,r)	!(x)

3. Creating And Modifying Custom Functions
To create custom Fucntions, input the function in the following format:

			functionName(var1, var2, ...) --> expression

For example, To create function f(x,y,z) with expression x*y*z

			f(x,y,z) --> x * y * z

To Modify an existing custom function, input the modified function in the following format:

			functionName(newVar1, newVar2, ...) --> new expression

For example,
			f(x,y,z) -->
