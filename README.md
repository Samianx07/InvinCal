# InvinCal
InvinCal is a calculator with functions, which can be written in Java with high flexibility, or created in runtine by combining the availables function for temporary use (not implemented). Creating custom constants will be available in later versions. I am also planning to add 'programs' to the calculator, just as the programs available in the calculator you use in college or high school. Of course, custom programs can be added with the help of Java.
