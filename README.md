This calculator is able to evaluate expressions. You may also create your own constants and functions.

1.Inputting Expressions
----------------------

You may input expressions in the way you normally do in maths. Only that this calculator can only recognize the following operations:

    +     -     *     /     f(x,y,z,...)
