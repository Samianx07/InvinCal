Welcome to InvinCal.

This caculator can evaluate expressions. You may also create functions and constants.

Inputting Expression:   3 + 4 * factorial(5)

Creating Custom Function: f(x) --> x * x * x 

Modifying Custom Function: f(x) --> x   f(x,y,z) --> x * y * z

Creating/Modifying Constant so that the definition is the value of the expression: c -> 3 + 4 / 2        c -> 3 + 4 * f(3)

Creaing/Modifying Constant so that the defintion is the expression itself: c ->--expression f(2)         if f(x) = x, c = 2. if f(x) = -x, c = -2.
